## [Unreleased]

(v0.8.0-rc.7-dev)

### Changed
- Split the project into a Cargo workspace with `secure-gate-core` (minimal, auditable core library published as `secure-gate`) and `secure-gate-compat` (isolates all `secrecy` migration shims, tests, and related code).
  - **This significantly reduces the security blast radius**: vulnerabilities or supply-chain issues in the compat layer can no longer impact the main library.
  - It also streamlines maintenance, CI test matrices, dependency management, and independent evolution of each crate.
  - Root `Cargo.toml` now defines the workspace (`members`, `resolver = "2"`, shared `[workspace.package]` metadata for version/edition/MSRV/license/etc.) and excludes `secure-gate-core/fuzz`; sub-crates inherit via `.workspace = true` fields.
