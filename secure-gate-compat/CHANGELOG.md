## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Extracted the compatibility layer into its own published crate (`secure-gate-compat`).
  - Previously part of the main `secure-gate` crate; now isolated to reduce the security blast radius and simplify the core library.
  - Includes all `secrecy-compat` features, `v08`/`v10` shims, migration tests, dual-compat parity tests, and related documentation.
- Updated imports, manifests, doctests, and CI to reflect the new workspace structure (`secure-gate-core` + `secure-gate-compat`).

See the core [`secure-gate` changelog](../secure-gate-core/CHANGELOG.md) for the full project history (including the initial workspace split and all pre-0.9 changes).
